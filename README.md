## Features
- **Dual Voltage Outputs**:
  - Adjustable output voltage using the LM317 regulator.
  - Fixed 5V output using the LM7805 regulator.
- **Barrel Jack Input**:
  - Accepts a standard DC barrel jack for power input.
- **Screw Terminals**:
  - Easy connection for input and output wires.
- **LED Indicator**:
  - Power-on LED to indicate when the supply is active.
- **Compact Design**:
  - Optimized for use with breadboards and prototyping.

## Schematic and PCB Design
The project is designed using **KiCad**, an open-source electronics design automation (EDA) suite. The repository includes:
- Schematic files (`.sch`)
- PCB layout files (`.kicad_pcb`)
- Component libraries and footprints.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- KiCad (version 6.0 or later) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of PCB design and soldering.

### Steps to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lendzeg/breadboard-power-supply.git
   ```
2. Open the KiCad project file (`breadboard-power-supply.pro`) in KiCad.
3. Review the schematic and PCB layout.
4. Generate Gerber files for manufacturing or modify the design as needed.
5. Assemble the components on the PCB as per the schematic.
